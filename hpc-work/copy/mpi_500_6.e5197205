  Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Environment variable MPI_ROOT is set to:

    /apps/mpi/intel/2019.8.254/compilers_and_libraries_2020.2.254/linux/mpi/intel64

  For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
